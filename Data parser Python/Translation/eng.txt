Why do you insist on wasting my time?
You lack the gravitas to be in the presence of Team GO Rocket. I’ll finish this quickly.
Well, if you insist on battling, as a Trainer, I must accept. However, you will pay for inconveniencing me.
You have such an air of arrogance about you. Allow me to dispel it for you.
Your insolence disgusts me. I’ll make sure your confidence is utterly shattered following this battle.
Your sense of self-importance sickens me. Are you prepared to be wholly humiliated?
Your arrogance will be your downfall, and I shall be the one to set that in motion.
Loss is not a concept I’m acquainted with. I don’t expect that will change after this battle.
A person of your stature shouldn’t be this confident. Fret not—I’ll do you the honor of teaching you this lesson.
Usually I wouldn’t consider debasing myself by battling a commoner...but I’ll make an exception to humiliate you.
How...how can this be? I...I never lose!
How dare you...humiliate me like this?
I haven’t felt this much humiliation since I lost my battle with Candela... You’ll pay for this.
The last person to humiliate me like this was Candela. You’ll all pay for this...
I...I don’t understand... I never lose...
Oh? Are you here to challenge me? Don’t test me.
Pokémon are my tools, and winning is my birthright. Get in my way, and you’ll be crushed, vermin.
Are you the best that Candela and her little friends could find?
Tch... How dare riffraff such as yourself speak to me?
Only a fool would challenge me.
Team GO Rocket’s domination is inevitable. Submit and you may be spared.
Pokémon are our tools. We are entitled to power them up as we so choose. Commoners such as yourself would never understand.
My sole purpose in life is to win. I’ll vanquish whoever dares to get in my way.
Oh, do YOU think you can beat me? Someone of your standing? Hah!
What a fool you are to even think of battling me.
Don’t be too disappointed. It was always going to end like this.
I never lose. Now get out of my sight.
If this is the best Candela and her little friends can offer, Team GO Rocket has nothing to worry about.
If the rest of the Trainers of this world are like you, then Team GO Rocket’s success is assured.
It was foolish of you to think you could beat me. It’s because of my brilliance that we have Shadow Pokémon!

Pfft... You wanna fight?

Why stop the inevitable? Team GO Rocket will always win!
Why do you fight us? Team GO Rocket gave so many of us a community—a purpose. What’s wrong with that?
Hahaha! What’d I tell ya? Of course I’d win!
Yes! I hope you’re proud of me, Boss.
Heh heh... That’s right. I beat you!
I’d never let the boss down!
That’s right! Team GO Rocket never loses!

Prepare yourself for a world of pain.
I’d say to prepare for battle, but you have already lost.
Humble yourself. You are facing the world’s greatest Trainer.
If you insist on disrupting my plans, I will insist on making you regret it.
You have no idea who you are challenging, child.
You underestimate Team GO Rocket. Prepare for battle.
There is no stopping my plans.
Two things are inevitable: my success and your failure.
You have proven yourself by reaching me, so I shall spare you a moment of my time.
You may have made it here, but this is as far as you’ll go.
What?! This can’t be!
Your love of Pokémon gave you the advantage...this time.
... ... ...I shall step aside this time!
This defeat is meaningless. Team GO Rocket will never fall!
This isn’t over. We will meet on the battlefield again.
I must say—I am impressed you got here.
What’s this now? I hope you are a worthy opponent.
I am the leader of this enterprise...Giovanni!
Fwahahahaha!
How dare you?! You will pay for your insolence!
Your Pokémon exist for Team GO Rocket’s use.
I commend you for standing up to me, Trainer. I trust you’ll make this worth my time.
You are foolish to confront me, but I’m impressed by your confidence. Let’s battle.
My goal is beyond your comprehension.
If you insist on confronting me, you will pay the price!
You found a Super Rocket Radar!
The Super Rocket Radar is a stronger radar that can find headquarters where the Team GO Rocket Boss might be!
What an amusing Trainer.
As expected, Team GO Rocket cannot be stopped.
You cannot stop my master plan.
Do not try to interfere again.
You failed as soon as you challenged me, Trainer.

Curious... Upon their defeat, your opponent seems to have abandoned the Pokémon they battled with. It has a strange and ominous aura.
I have a hypothesis about what kind of Pokémon it is... Could you catch it so we can examine it more closely?
Your opponent fled...and left their Pokémon behind. That really burns me up. There seems to be an ominous aura around the poor Pokémon, too.
Could you try to catch it and see what’s so different about this Pokémon?
They’ve carelessly abandoned the Pokémon they lost with! It has an ominous aura and is somewhat different from regular Pokémon. Try to catch it so we can save it!
They’ve carelessly abandoned the Pokémon they lost with! It has an ominous aura and is somewhat different from regular Pokémon. Try to catch it so we can save it!
Whoa, looks like they couldn’t handle a little battle! They even left behind their Pokémon. Why would they do that?
It has a really odd aura around it... Let’s help it! Can you catch it so we can take a closer look?
Professor Willow’s ingenuity knows no bounds.
Once equipped, the Super Rocket Radar begins receiving encrypted signals. Could the signals be coming from Team GO Rocket Headquarters?
Best prepare for any obstacles that might appear. Team GO Rocket’s numbers are staggering.
Their leader is strong but no match for Team Mystic. Let’s GO.
Just look at this radar! You can just tell it’s more powerful than the others!
My bet? It’s receiving signals from Team GO Rocket Headquarters.
I’m getting fired up, but I know there have to be more hurdles before facing the Team GO Rocket Boss.
I’ve heard their boss is fierce... But you’re on Team Valor, so I know you can handle it.
This radar looks upgraded and WAY more powerful than others we’ve made!
Think it’ll take us to whoever’s leading Team GO Rocket?
I know it can’t be that easy. I bet Team GO Rocket has plenty more Grunts blocking our way.
I’m ready if you are! Equip that radar, and let’s show ’em what Team Instinct is made of!
Professor Willow’s research and the components you’ve discovered have come together to produce a Rocket Radar.
We’ve reverse engineered their technology and can now receive their hideouts’ signals.
Equip the radar to activate it. It’s time to investigate—and be prepared for whatever comes our way.
Great work! Fighting all those Grunts was worth the effort!
A Rocket Radar! Professor Willow said once it’s equipped, you can intercept signals from Team GO Rocket.
Finally, we can find those hideouts! Let’s GO take out these punks!
Whoa! I knew the professor was right when he said these things could be used for something aside from hacking PokéStops!
Is that a radar? Awesome! There’s no way they can hide from us with this!
Let’s try it out and track down some hideouts!
Trainer, some shadowy figures have been seen at PokéStops. Approach with caution, and be ready for battle.
I’ve been hearing reports of some mysterious characters near PokéStops. You should take charge and go investigate. Be careful, and make sure you’re prepared for a battle!
Some mysterious characters have shown up at PokéStops! Watch out—it might turn into a battle!
Some mysterious characters have shown up at PokéStops! Watch out—it might turn into a battle!
I overheard that some shady characters have been showing up at PokéStops. I think you need to check it out, but be careful—I have a feeling you might end up in a battle!
That Grunt dropped some sort of device. It looks like this is what they were using to hack the PokéStops.
Ah, I recognize this from Willow’s lab. I wonder...
Yes. I believe this can help with his prototype. Please head out and collect more.
That Grunt dropped something while they were running scared! What are they using these for?
I bet this is what Team GO Rocket is using to hack the PokéStops...
We have to find more. Time to battle some Grunts!
Hey... That Grunt dropped something. What does this thing do?
This looks like a piece of something right out of Willow’s lab!
I bet this will help with that prototype he’s developing... Let’s see if we can find more.
If my analysis is correct, we can help this Pokémon through a process known as purification. This will enable it to harness its strength. Shall we give it a try?
I think we can help this Pokémon. Purification is a process that makes certain Pokémon stronger by tapping into their inner power. Let’s give it a try.
It looks like we can help this Pokémon become stronger through a process called purification. Let’s try it!

Hello there!I am Professor Willow.
Did you know that this world is inhabited by creatures known as Pokémon?
Pokémon can be found in every corner of the earth.
Some run across the plains, others fly through the skies, some live in the mountains, or in the forests, or near water…
I have spent my whole life studying them and their geography.
Will you help me with my research?
That’s great!
You’ll need to find and collect Pokémon from everywhere.

Please enter a complete title.
A PokéStop is an in-game location that encourages Trainers to go outside, discover new places, and connect with people in the community. PokéStops usually contain some kind of civic, educational, or artistic value, whether it’s a cool piece of art or a hidden gem that only the locals know.
Submit a name, description, and photo of the location you’ve selected. Your nominated PokéStop will then be reviewed by other Niantic players, so please be thorough and accurate!
PokéStops should have educational and cultural value, and their locations should be safe and accessible to pedestrians. Avoid nominating locations at private residences, locations that are seasonal or nonpermanent, or locations that could interfere with emergency service vehicles. 
Write a concise title and a detailed description of your nominated PokéStop. The title should be an official name when possible. The description should include the history, cultural significance, or educational value of your location. Write the title and description yourself and please do not copy from other resources.

Pokémon Day
--
Bulbasaur can be seen napping in bright sunlight. There is a seed on its back. By soaking up the sun's rays, the seed grows progressively larger.
There is a bud on this Pokémon's back. To support its weight, Ivysaur's legs and trunk grow thick and strong. If it starts spending more time lying in the sunlight, it's a sign that the bud will bloom into a large flower soon.
There is a large flower on Venusaur's back. The flower is said to take on vivid colors if it gets plenty of nutrition and sunlight. The flower's aroma soothes the emotions of people.
The flame that burns at the tip of its tail is an indication of its emotions. The flame wavers when Charmander is enjoying itself. If the Pokémon becomes enraged, the flame burns fiercely.
Charmeleon mercilessly destroys its foes using its sharp claws. If it encounters a strong foe, it turns aggressive. In this excited state, the flame at the tip of its tail flares with a bluish white color.
Charizard flies around the sky in search of powerful opponents. It breathes fire of such great heat that it melts anything. However, it never turns its fiery breath on any opponent weaker than itself.
Squirtle's shell is not merely used for protection. The shell's rounded shape and the grooves on its surface help minimize resistance in water, enabling this Pokémon to swim at high speeds.
Its tail is large and covered with a rich, thick fur. The tail becomes increasingly deeper in color as Wartortle ages. The scratches on its shell are evidence of this Pokémon's toughness as a battler.
Blastoise has water spouts that protrude from its shell. The water spouts are very accurate. They can shoot bullets of water with enough accuracy to strike empty cans from a distance of over 160 feet.
Caterpie has a voracious appetite. It can devour leaves bigger than its body right before your eyes. From its antenna, this Pokémon releases a terrifically strong odor.
The shell covering this Pokémon's body is as hard as an iron slab. Metapod does not move very much. It stays still because it is preparing its soft innards for evolution inside the hard shell.
Butterfree has a superior ability to search for delicious honey from flowers. It can even search out, extract, and carry honey from flowers that are blooming over six miles from its nest.
Weedle has an extremely acute sense of smell. It is capable of distinguishing its favorite kinds of leaves from those it dislikes just by sniffing with its big red proboscis (nose).
Kakuna remains virtually immobile as it clings to a tree. However, on the inside, it is extremely busy as it prepares for its coming evolution. This is evident from how hot the shell becomes to the touch.
Beedrill is extremely territorial. No one should ever approach its nest—this is for their own safety. If angered, they will attack in a furious swarm.
Pidgey has an extremely sharp sense of direction. It is capable of unerringly returning home to its nest, however far it may be removed from its familiar surroundings.
Pidgeotto claims a large area as its own territory. This Pokémon flies around, patrolling its living space. If its territory is violated, it shows no mercy in thoroughly punishing the foe with its sharp claws.
This Pokémon has a dazzling plumage of beautifully glossy feathers. Many Trainers are captivated by the striking beauty of the feathers on its head, compelling them to choose Pidgeot as their Pokémon.
Rattata is cautious in the extreme. Even while it is asleep, it constantly listens by moving its ears around. It is not picky about where it lives—it will make its nest anywhere.
Night after night, they sneak into people's homes seeking food. A massive outbreak of them has become an issue of public concern.
Raticate's sturdy fangs grow steadily. To keep them ground down, it gnaws on rocks and logs. It may even chew on the walls of houses.
It commands a nest of Rattata. Different nests don't get along, whipping up severe fights over feeding grounds.
Spearow has a very loud cry that can be heard over half a mile away. If its high, keening cry is heard echoing all around, it is a sign that they are warning each other of danger.
Fearow is recognized by its long neck and elongated beak. They are conveniently shaped for catching prey in soil or water. It deftly moves its long and skinny beak to pluck prey.
Ekans curls itself up in a spiral while it rests. Assuming this position allows it to quickly respond to a threat from any direction with a glare from its upraised head.
This Pokémon is terrifically strong in order to constrict things with its body. It can even flatten steel oil drums. Once Arbok wraps its body around its foe, escaping its crushing embrace is impossible.
Whenever Pikachu comes across something new, it blasts it with a jolt of electricity. If you come across a blackened berry, it's evidence that this Pokémon mistook the intensity of its charge.
If the electrical sacs become excessively charged, Raichu plants its tail in the ground and discharges. Scorched patches of ground will be found near this Pokémon's nest.
When you rub its cheeks, a sweet fragrance comes wafting out. However, you'll also get a light shock!
Sandshrew's body is configured to absorb water without waste, enabling it to survive in an arid desert. This Pokémon curls up to protect itself from its enemies.
The skin on its back is as hard as steel. Predators go after its soft belly, so it clings to the ground desperately.
Sandslash's body is covered by tough spikes, which are hardened sections of its hide. Once a year, the old spikes fall out, to be replaced with new spikes that grow out from beneath the old ones.
A long, long time ago, it lived in the desert. With its sharp claws fully extended, it can climb right up an iceberg without slipping.
Nidoran♀ has barbs that secrete a powerful poison. They are thought to have developed as protection for this small-bodied Pokémon. When enraged, it releases a horrible toxin from its horn.
When Nidorina are with their friends or family, they keep their barbs tucked away to prevent hurting each other. This Pokémon appears to become nervous if separated from the others.
Nidoqueen's body is encased in extremely hard scales. It is adept at sending foes flying with harsh tackles. This Pokémon is at its strongest when it is defending its young.
Nidoran♂ has developed muscles for moving its ears. Thanks to them, the ears can be freely moved in any direction. Even the slightest sound does not escape this Pokémon's notice.
Nidorino has a horn that is harder than a diamond. If it senses a hostile presence, all the barbs on its back bristle up at once, and it challenges the foe with all its might.
Nidoking's thick tail packs enormously destructive power. With one swing, it can topple a metal transmission tower. Once this Pokémon goes on a rampage, there is no stopping it.
On every night of a full moon, groups of this Pokémon come out to play. When dawn arrives, the tired Clefairy return to their quiet mountain retreats and go to sleep nestled up against each other.
Clefable moves by skipping lightly as if it were flying using its wings. Its bouncy step lets it even walk on water. It is known to take strolls on lakes on quiet, moonlit nights.
At the time of its birth, Vulpix has one white tail. The tail separates into six if this Pokémon receives plenty of love from its Trainer. The six tails become magnificently curled.
They live together in a skulk, helping one another. Before eating their prey, they freeze it solid with their –58 degree Fahrenheit breath.
Ninetales casts a sinister light from its bright red eyes to gain total control over its foe's mind. This Pokémon is said to live for a thousand years.
Some said that deities visited mountains where Ninetales live, so in times long past, no one was allowed to go into those mountains.
Jigglypuff's vocal cords can freely adjust the wavelength of its voice. This Pokémon uses this ability to sing at precisely the right wavelength to make its foes most drowsy.
Wigglytuff has large, saucerlike eyes. The surfaces of its eyes are always covered with a thin layer of tears. If any dust gets in this Pokémon's eyes, it is quickly washed away.
Zubat remains quietly unmoving in a dark spot during the bright daylight hours. It does so because prolonged exposure to the sun causes its body to become slightly burned.
Golbat loves to drink the blood of living things. It is particularly active in the pitch black of night. This Pokémon flits around in the night skies, seeking fresh blood.
During the daytime, Oddish buries itself in soil to absorb nutrients from the ground using its entire body. The more fertile the soil, the glossier its leaves become.
Gloom releases a foul fragrance from the pistil of its flower. When faced with danger, the stench worsens. If this Pokémon is feeling calm and secure, it does not release its usual stinky aroma.
Vileplume's toxic pollen triggers atrocious allergy attacks. That's why it is advisable never to approach any attractive flowers in a jungle, however pretty they may be.
Paras has parasitic mushrooms growing on its back called tochukaso. They grow large by drawing nutrients from this Bug Pokémon host. They are highly valued as a medicine for extending life.
Parasect is known to infest large trees en masse and drain nutrients from the lower trunk and roots. When an infested tree dies, they move onto another tree all at once.
Venonat is said to have evolved with a coat of thin, stiff hair that covers its entire body for protection. It possesses large eyes that never fail to spot even minuscule prey.
Venomoth is nocturnal—it is a Pokémon that only becomes active at night. Its favorite prey are small insects that gather around streetlights, attracted by the light in the darkness.
Diglett are raised in most farms. The reason is simple—wherever this Pokémon burrows, the soil is left perfectly tilled for planting crops. This soil is made ideal for growing delicious vegetables.
The need to dig through volcanic rock in the ground has made them more powerful than the Diglett of other regions.
Dugtrio are actually triplets that emerged from one body. As a result, each triplet thinks exactly like the other two triplets. They work cooperatively to burrow endlessly.
Its shining gold whiskers are advanced sensors that can detect vibrations from sounds several miles away.
Meowth withdraws its sharp claws into its paws to slinkily sneak about without making any incriminating footsteps. For some reason, this Pokémon loves shiny coins that glitter with light.
A royal house that flourished in the distant past brought it here from another region. Meowth is both selfish and prideful.
Living with a savage, seafaring people has toughened this Pokémon's body so much that parts of it have turned to iron.
Persian has six bold whiskers that give it a look of toughness. The whiskers sense air movements to determine what is in the Pokémon's surrounding vicinity. It becomes docile if grabbed by the whiskers.
Its round face is a symbol of wealth. Persian that have bigger, plumper faces are considered more beautiful.
Psyduck uses a mysterious power. When it does so, this Pokémon generates brain waves that are supposedly only seen in sleepers. This discovery spurred controversy among scholars.
The webbed flippers on its forelegs and hind legs and the streamlined body of Golduck give it frightening speed. This Pokémon is definitely much faster than even the most athletic swimmer.
When Mankey starts shaking and its nasal breathing turns rough, it's a sure sign that it is becoming angry. However, because it goes into a towering rage almost instantly, it is impossible for anyone to flee its wrath.
When Primeape becomes furious, its blood circulation is boosted. In turn, its muscles are made even stronger. However, it also becomes much less intelligent at the same time.
Growlithe has a superb sense of smell. Once it smells anything, this Pokémon won't forget the scent, no matter what. It uses its advanced olfactory sense to determine the emotions of other living things.
Arcanine is known for its high speed. It is said to be capable of running over 6,200 miles in a single day and night. The fire that blazes wildly within this Pokémon's body is its source of power.
Poliwag has a very thin skin. It is possible to see the Pokémon's spiral innards right through the skin. Despite its thinness, however, the skin is also very flexible. Even sharp fangs bounce right off it.
The surface of Poliwhirl's body is always wet and slick with a slimy fluid. Because of this slippery covering, it can easily slip and slide out of the clutches of any enemy in battle.
Poliwrath's highly developed, brawny muscles never grow fatigued, however much it exercises. It is so tirelessly strong, this Pokémon can swim back and forth across the ocean without effort.
Abra sleeps for 18 hours a day. However, it can sense the presence of foes even while it is sleeping. In such a situation, this Pokémon immediately teleports to safety.
Kadabra emits a peculiar alpha wave if it develops a headache. Only those people with a particularly strong psyche can hope to become a Trainer of this Pokémon.
Alakazam's brain continually grows, making its head far too heavy to support with its neck. This Pokémon holds its head up using its psychokinetic power instead.
Machop's muscles are special—they never get sore no matter how much they are used in exercise. This Pokémon has sufficient power to hurl a hundred adult humans.
Machoke's thoroughly toned muscles possess the hardness of steel. This Pokémon has so much strength, it can easily hold aloft a sumo wrestler on just one finger.
Machamp has the power to hurl anything aside. However, trying to do any work requiring care and dexterity causes its arms to get tangled. This Pokémon tends to leap into action before it thinks.
Bellsprout's thin and flexible body lets it bend and sway to avoid any attack, however strong it may be. From its mouth, this Pokémon spits a corrosive fluid that melts even iron.
Weepinbell has a large hook on its rear end. At night, the Pokémon hooks on to a tree branch and goes to sleep. If it moves around in its sleep, it may wake up to find itself on the ground.
Victreebel has a long vine that extends from its head. This vine is waved and flicked about as if it were an animal to attract prey. When an unsuspecting prey draws near, this Pokémon swallows it whole.
Tentacool's body is largely composed of water. If it is removed from the sea, it dries up like parchment. If this Pokémon happens to become dehydrated, put it back into the sea.
Tentacruel has large red orbs on its head. The orbs glow before lashing the vicinity with a harsh ultrasonic blast. This Pokémon's outburst creates rough waves around it.
The longer a Geodude lives, the more its edges are chipped and worn away, making it more rounded in appearance. However, this Pokémon's heart will remain hard, craggy, and rough always.
Geodude compete against each other with headbutts. The iron sand on their heads will stick to whichever one has stronger magnetism.
Graveler grows by feeding on rocks. Apparently, it prefers to eat rocks that are covered in moss. This Pokémon eats its way through a ton of rocks on a daily basis.
Graveler's entire body is tinged with electricity due to the stones it likes to eat. It's very quick-tempered.
Golem live up on mountains. If there is a large earthquake, these Pokémon will come rolling down off the mountains en masse to the foothills below.
It shoots large rocks that are charged with electricity. Tremendous electric shocks are flung out across the whole area of impact.
Ponyta is very weak at birth. It can barely stand up. This Pokémon becomes stronger by stumbling and falling to keep up with its parent.
Rapidash usually can be seen casually cantering in the fields and plains. However, when this Pokémon turns serious, its fiery manes flare and blaze as it gallops its way up to 150 mph.
Slowpoke uses its tail to catch prey by dipping it in water at the side of a river. However, this Pokémon often forgets what it's doing and often spends entire days just loafing at water's edge.
Slowbro's tail has a Shellder firmly attached with a bite. As a result, the tail can't be used for fishing anymore. This causes Slowbro to grudgingly swim and catch prey instead.
Magnemite attaches itself to power lines to feed on electricity. If your house has a power outage, check your circuit breakers. You may find a large number of this Pokémon clinging to the breaker box.
Magneton emits a powerful magnetic force that is fatal to mechanical devices. As a result, large cities sound sirens to warn citizens of large-scale outbreaks of this Pokémon.
Farfetch'd is always seen with a stalk from a plant of some sort. Apparently, there are good stalks and bad stalks. This Pokémon has been known to fight with others over stalks.
The Farfetch'd of the Galar region are brave warriors, and they wield thick, tough leeks in battle.
Doduo's two heads never sleep at the same time. Its two heads take turns sleeping, so one head can always keep watch for enemies while the other one sleeps.
Watch out if Dodrio's three heads are looking in three separate directions. It's a sure sign that it is on its guard. Don't go near this Pokémon if it's being wary—it may decide to peck you.
Seel hunts for prey in the frigid sea underneath sheets of ice. When it needs to breathe, it punches a hole through the ice with the sharply protruding section of its head.
Dewgong loves to snooze on bitterly cold ice. The sight of this Pokémon sleeping on a glacier was mistakenly thought to be a mermaid by a mariner long ago.
Grimer's sludgy and rubbery body can be forced through any opening, however small it may be. This Pokémon enters sewer pipes to drink filthy wastewater.
Brought to Alola to solve the garbage problem, Grimer seems to relish any and all kinds of trash.
From Muk's body seeps a foul fluid that gives off a nose-bendingly horrible stench. Just one drop of this Pokémon's body fluid can turn a pool stagnant and rancid.
What look like fangs and claws are actually crystallized poison that will afflict you at a mere touch, so don't get too close.
At night, this Pokémon uses its broad tongue to burrow a hole in the seafloor sand and then sleep in it. While it is sleeping, Shellder closes its shell, but leaves its tongue hanging out.
Cloyster is capable of swimming in the sea. It does so by swallowing water, then jetting it out toward the rear. This Pokémon shoots spikes from its shell using the same system.
Gastly is largely composed of gaseous matter. When exposed to a strong wind, the gaseous body quickly dwindles away. Groups of this Pokémon cluster under the eaves of houses to escape the ravages of wind.
Haunter is a dangerous Pokémon. If one beckons you while floating in darkness, you must never approach it. This Pokémon will try to lick you with its tongue and steal your life away.
Sometimes, on a dark night, your shadow thrown by a streetlight will suddenly and startlingly overtake you. It is actually a Gengar running past you, pretending to be your shadow.
Onix has a magnet in its brain. It acts as a compass so that this Pokémon does not lose direction while it is tunneling. As it grows older, its body becomes increasingly rounder and smoother.
If your nose becomes itchy while you are sleeping, it's a sure sign that one of these Pokémon is standing above your pillow and trying to eat your dream through your nostrils.
Hypno holds a pendulum in its hand. The arcing movement and glitter of the pendulum lull the foe into a deep state of hypnosis. While this Pokémon searches for prey, it polishes the pendulum.
Krabby live on beaches, burrowed inside holes dug into the sand. On sandy beaches with little in the way of food, these Pokémon can be seen squabbling with each other over territory.
Kingler has an enormous, oversized claw. It waves this huge claw in the air to communicate with others. However, because the claw is so heavy, the Pokémon quickly tires.
Voltorb was first sighted at a company that manufactures Poké Balls. The link between that sighting and the fact that this Pokémon looks very similar to a Poké Ball remains a mystery.
Electrode eats electricity in the atmosphere. On days when lightning strikes, you can see this Pokémon exploding all over the place from eating too much electricity.
This Pokémon consists of six eggs that form a closely knit cluster. The six eggs attract each other and spin around. When cracks increasingly appear on the eggs, Exeggcute is close to evolution.
Exeggutor originally came from the tropics. Its heads steadily grow larger from exposure to strong sunlight. It is said that when the heads fall off, they group together to form Exeggcute.
It swings its long neck like a whip and smacks its opponents. This makes Exeggutor itself dizzy, too.
Cubone pines for the mother it will never see again. Seeing a likeness of its mother in the full moon, it cries. The stains on the skull the Pokémon wears are made by the tears it sheds.
Marowak is the evolved form of a Cubone that has overcome its sadness at the loss of its mother and grown tough. This Pokémon's tempered and hardened spirit is not easily broken.
When it beats opponents with its bone, the cursed flames spread to them. No amount of water will stop those flames from burning.
Hitmonlee's legs freely contract and stretch. Using these springlike legs, it bowls over foes with devastating kicks. After battle, it rubs down its legs and loosens the muscles to overcome fatigue.
Hitmonchan is said to possess the spirit of a boxer who had been working toward a world championship. This Pokémon has an indomitable spirit and will never give up in the face of adversity.
Whenever Lickitung comes across something new, it will unfailingly give it a lick. It does so because it memorizes things by texture and by taste. It is somewhat put off by sour things.
If Koffing becomes agitated, it raises the toxicity of its internal gases and jets them out from all over its body. This Pokémon may also overinflate its round body, then explode.
Weezing loves the gases given off by rotted kitchen garbage. This Pokémon will find a dirty, unkempt house and make it its home. At night, when the people in the house are asleep, it will go through the trash.
This Pokémon consumes particles that contaminate the air. Instead of leaving droppings, it expels clean air.
Rhyhorn runs in a straight line, smashing everything in its path. It is not bothered even if it rushes headlong into a block of steel. This Pokémon may feel some pain from the collision the next day, however.
Rhydon's horn can crush even uncut diamonds. One sweeping blow of its tail can topple a building. This Pokémon's hide is extremely tough. Even direct cannon hits don't leave a scratch.
Chansey lays nutritionally excellent eggs on an everyday basis. The eggs are so delicious, they are easily and eagerly devoured by even those people who have lost their appetite.
Tangela's vines snap off easily if they are grabbed. This happens without pain, allowing it to make a quick getaway. The lost vines are replaced by newly grown vines the very next day.
If you come across a young Kangaskhan playing by itself, you must never disturb it or attempt to catch it. The baby Pokémon's parent is sure to be in the area, and it will become violently enraged at you.
Horsea eats small insects and moss off of rocks. If the ocean current turns fast, this Pokémon anchors itself by wrapping its tail around rocks or coral to prevent being washed away.
Seadra sleeps after wriggling itself between the branches of coral. Those trying to harvest coral are occasionally stung by this Pokémon's poison barbs if they fail to notice it.
Goldeen is a very beautiful Pokémon with fins that billow elegantly in water. However, don't let your guard down around this Pokémon—it could ram you powerfully with its horn.

This Pokémon is shrouded in mystery. It's said to have appeared from a UFO that fell from the sky about 50 years ago.
It has strong psychic powers. Using its fingers that flash three different colors, it controls its opponents and rewrites their memories.
Litwick shines a light that absorbs the life energy of people and Pokémon, which becomes the fuel that it burns.
It arrives near the moment of death and steals spirit from the body.
The spirits burned up in its ominous flame lose their way and wander this world forever.
They mark their territory by leaving gashes in trees with their tusks. If a tusk breaks, a new one grows in quickly.
A broken tusk will not grow back, so it diligently sharpens its tusks on river rocks after the end of a battle.
Their sturdy tusks will stay sharp even if used to cut steel beams. These Pokémon are covered in hard armor.
Their snot is a barometer of health. When healthy, their snot is sticky and the power of their ice moves increases.
It freezes its breath to create fangs and claws of ice to fight with. Cold northern areas are its habitat.
They are composed of ice crystals. They capture prey with chains of ice, freezing the prey at -148 degrees Fahrenheit.
It evolves when bathed in an electric-like energy along with Karrablast. The reason is still unknown.
When its body dries out, it weakens. So, to prevent dehydration, it wraps itself in many layers of thin membrane.
It conceals itself in the mud of the seashore. Then it waits. When prey touch it, it delivers a jolt of electricity.
Living in mud with a high iron content has given it a strong steel body.
They seclude themselves in the mountains and devote themselves to training. The form of their kicks and chops differs from pack to pack.
When Mienshao lets out a bizarre wail, you're in danger. A flurry of kicks and chops too fast to see is about to be unleashed!
It infiltrates tunnels that Pokémon like Diglett and Dugtrio have dug and quietly waits for prey to pass through.
Although ancient people apparently built it by working with clay, the source of its energy is unclear.
When the seal on its chest is removed, it rages indiscriminately, turning the whole town around it into a mountain of rubble.
It follows Bisharp's orders to a tee when it attacks enemies. After slashing an opponent, Pawniard clangs both of its blades together.
It leads a group of Pawniard. Bisharp doesn't even change its expression when it deals the finishing blow to an opponent.
Their fluffy fur absorbs damage, even if they strike foes with a fierce headbutt.
Known as a natural-born warrior, soon after its hatching, it will challenge its parent to a fight in order to gain their acceptance.
Known as “the hero of the skies," this Pokémon is so proud and so brave that it will never retreat, even when it's injured.
Its healthy appetite leads to visible growth spurts. It often has to replace the bones it wears as its size increases.
It's always searching for food for Vullaby. When it finds a weak Pokémon, Mandibuzz swoops it right off to its nest.
It draws in air through its tail, transforms it into fire, and uses it like a tongue. It melts Durant and eats them.
They attack in groups, covering themselves in steel armor to protect themselves from Heatmor.
Lacking sight, it's unaware of its surroundings, so it bumps into things and eats anything that moves.
After it has eaten up all the food in its territory, it moves to another area. Its two heads do not get along.
It responds to movement by attacking. This scary, three-headed Pokémon devours everything in its path!
It protects itself with flame. Long years ago, people believed Larvesta had a nest on the sun.
According to legends, it was hatched from a flaming cocoon to save people and Pokémon that were suffering from the cold.
It has a body and heart of steel. It worked with its allies to punish people when they hurt Pokémon.
Spoken of in legend, this Pokémon used its phenomenal power to destroy a castle in its effort to protect Pokémon.
Legends say this Pokémon confounded opponents with its swift movements.
Tornadus expels massive energy from its tail, causing severe storms. Its power is great enough to blow houses away.
As it flies around, it shoots lightning all over the place and causes forest fires. It is therefore disliked.
When Reshiram's tail flares, the heat energy moves the atmosphere and changes the world's weather.
Concealing itself in lightning clouds, it flies throughout the Unova region. It creates electricity in its tail.
From the forces of lightning and wind, it creates energy to give nutrients to the soil and make the land abundant.
It generates a powerful, freezing energy inside itself, but its body became frozen when the energy leaked out.
When it is resolute, its body fills with power and it becomes swifter. Its jumps are then too fast to follow.
Its melodies are sung with a special vocalization method that can control the feelings of those who hear it.
This Pokémon existed 300 million years ago. Team Plasma altered it and attached a cannon to its back.
It melts particles of iron and other metals found in the subsoil, so it can absorb them into its body of molten steel.
Revered long ago for its capacity to create iron from nothing, for some reason it has come back to life after 3,000 years.
Its voice is staggering in volume. Obstagoon has a tendency to take on a threatening posture and shout—this move is known as Obstruct.
What appears to be an iron helmet is actually hardened hair. This Pokémon lives for the thrill of battle.
Only Farfetch’d that have survived many battles can attain this evolution. When this Pokémon’s leek withers, it will retire from combat.

Daily Bonus
Great to see you again, %PLAYERNAME%. I always run into you when I find something exciting. Maybe you’re my Special Research good-luck charm!
Last night, I was studying the chemical reaction that causes Trubbish to appear.
Suddenly I saw bright flashing lights in the near distance and went to investigate.
When I arrived at the site, I noticed a lot of damage to the ground and the surrounding area.
At first, the damage looked to be caused by Trainers practicing for the GO Battle League, but my gut told me to investigate further in the morning.
While I look into this, can you help me research Normal-type Pokémon? Some of the damage looks like it was caused by a Normal-type attack.
Thanks for getting that baseline research taken care of for me, %PLAYERNAME%. I have some updates to share with you.
After I returned to the site we’re studying, I realized there was actually a trail of damage.
When I followed that trail, I started finding areas that were clearly burned.
That damage must have been done by a Fire-type Pokémon—or at least a Pokémon that knows Fire-type attacks.
You know what this means, Trainer! Time to research Fire-type Pokémon.
The more information we have about this type of Pokémon, the more clues we’ll have to determine whatever did all this damage.
Meanwhile, I’ll continue following the trail of damage.
Thanks, %PLAYERNAME%! You’ve been on fire when it comes to getting these research tasks done! Get it? You’re on fire?
Anyway...the damage can’t have been caused by a Trainer Battle. I’ve never seen anything like it before. It seems almost...unnatural?
Could it really have been caused by Pokémon? This is getting fascinating! Could you do some research on Water-type Pokémon for me?
As I followed the damage trail further, the burned area suddenly ended and strange water damage started appearing, and it just doesn’t seem to line up with any Pokémon I’ve encountered.
%PLAYERNAME%, I’m so glad you’re back! We might have stumbled upon something incredible.
I contacted one of my colleagues in the Unova region.
She shared some notes about a Mythical Pokémon called Genesect that was restored from a 300-million-year-old fossil and then altered.
Pretty cool, huh? The notes say that though this Pokémon is Bug and Steel type, it’s known to be able to use attacks with types like Fire and Water, among others.
This lines up with the damage at the site we’ve been researching!
One of the other types Genesect can attack with is Electric, and as I kept following the damage trail, I found spots that must have been hit by some kind of high-voltage Electric-type attack.
I’ll see if anything else lies even farther down the trail, but in the meantime, I know I can count on you to start investigating Electric-type Pokémon to help us get to the bottom of this.
I can’t thank you enough for your help, %PLAYERNAME%. You really are my Special Research good-luck charm!
With the information you collected combined with the notes from Unova, I think we’ve uncovered the Bug- and Steel-type Pokémon Genesect!
I know what you’re thinking: Bug AND Steel with such odd attack types?
Apparently, when this Pokémon is holding a specially developed item called a Drive, its Techno Blast attack changes to a type that corresponds to the Drive the Pokémon’s holding.
I wonder what kinds of Drives exist for this Pokémon.
I still have so many questions, but for now, why not do a little research on Ice-type Pokémon? I hear Ice is another type Genesect can wield.
You ought to take a snapshot of Genesect to commemorate your meeting, too!
Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%. Good to see you again. Your research inspired me to do some more research of my own, and I think I’ve come across something...groundbreaking.
I was investigating the digging patterns of Diglett, and I wound up heading deep into a cave. Inside, I came across some unusual markings carved heavily into the cavern walls. 
At first, I thought them to be random, but then I realized the carvings formed four unique patterns, each consisting of seven circles.
These patterns look incredibly familiar, and I think we need to take a closer look at some Pokémon in particular.
Can I count on you to help me research some Rock-type Pokémon?  I have a hunch that this will lead us to our first clue.
Simply amazing! The pattern on the Regirock you caught matches perfectly with the first pattern of carvings on the cave walls.
This leads me to believe we should move our investigation to Ice-type Pokémon. I wonder if we’ll find another Pokémon that will help us solve this puzzle.
I have one in mind, but I don’t want to get ahead of myself!
I’m sure with the help of an accomplished Trainer such as yourself, we’ll be on our way to figuring this out in no time.
As expected, Regice clearly has similar markings to the second carving I found in the cave.
I remember an ancient legend that told a story about a Colossal Pokémon. It’s said that it made Pokémon that looked like itself from a special ice mountain, rocks, and magma.
Could it be these Pokémon these patterns originate from? This is starting to get exciting, isn’t it?
If the first two Pokémon were Regirock and Regice...then there’s only one left that we must research further.
Excellent work. I believe we’re going in the right direction. This could only mean one thing, %PLAYERNAME%.
We’re close to coming across the Legendary Pokémon Regigigas! According to legend, this Pokémon towed continents with rope.
Maybe it can help move my research lab next time it gets stuck. Hahaha!
Anyway...I have a feeling that once you fully document these amazing creatures, you’ll make a colossal discovery of your own.
Welcome to GO Fest 2019, %PLAYERNAME%! I’m glad you’re here.
I discovered something fascinating during my research, and I need your help. I’ve come across what I believe to be a rare Pokémon deep in slumber.
We have our work cut out for us, %PLAYERNAME%. I think this adventure is going to call for some resources and even the help of some friends.
Could you collect some supplies? Meanwhile, I’ll see if I can find anything about this Pokémon in any of my texts.
Good work, %PLAYERNAME%. I’m sure the resources you’ve earned will be crucial.
I had some success in my research, as well. I came across an ancient text containing the story of a Mythical Pokémon that grants wishes.
I’m still researching the best way to awaken this Pokémon, but I keep hearing reports of other Pokémon in the area showing signs of distress.
Could I ask you to investigate these reports?
Well done, %PLAYERNAME%! I knew I could count on you. You know, something interesting came up when I reviewed your results.
Many of the Pokémon you encountered seem to have strayed from their habitats.
I’d like you to help them get back to their proper habitats, as I’m sure this will soothe them and make them more comfortable. This should be a breeze for an accomplished Trainer like you!
As you return the Pokémon to their proper habitats, be sure to snap pictures to help document this unusual situation.
Wonderful work, %PLAYERNAME%! You’re certainly getting the hang of that camera! Did you notice anything strange while taking photos of Pokémon in their habitats?
Apparently there’s an unusual phenomenon where Pokémon leap out in an attempt to appear in your photos. I’ve heard Spark refer to it as a “photobomb.”
I’m eternally amused—and amazed—by the things we learn about Pokémon every day. That said, I did notice a connection.
These Pokémon all seem to have something in common—music! I have a hunch that music may be the key to awakening our slumbering Pokémon.
What do you think, %PLAYERNAME%? Shall we set the stage and see if some beautiful music is the answer to this perplexing situation?
That’s it! The pure melody created by your musical Pokémon has awakened the Steel- and Psychic-type Pokémon Jirachi!
The ancient text was right—this Mythical Pokémon could only be awakened from its thousand-year slumber by a song of purity. The text also says that when Jirachi awakens, it grants wishes!
Now that we’ve done the work of waking Jirachi up, I wonder what you and your fellow Trainers will wish for. I already know what my wish is going to be—I want you to enjoy this amazing experience!
It isn’t every day that you get to join Trainers from all over the world in exploring a park with so many Pokémon in such diverse habitats—not to mention meeting a Mythical Pokémon!
I’m sure Jirachi was far from the last amazing discovery to be made, though. I’ll no doubt be calling on your excellent research skills again in the future!
Nice to see you again, %PLAYERNAME%! I’m excited to get started on our next big adventure. 
What do we need to do? Well, I’ve come across something amazing, and I need your help.
We’re going to focus our efforts on Pokémon originally discovered in the Hoenn region, because I have some leads on a Pokémon I’ve never seen before! 
First, we need to get some baseline research to help track this Pokémon. 
Can you explore the area? Who knows—you might make some friends along the way.
Great job, Trainer. Your work helped me get a better understanding of the search area for this mysterious Pokémon. I can’t wait to show you what I’ve been working on.
A few weeks ago, I came across an ancient text that was found in the Hoenn region. It was filled with fascinating information. 
It mentions a Mythical Pokémon that awakens once every thousand years and has the ability to grant wishes!
I really want to get a deeper understanding of this text, and how better to do that than with some research? Can you help me collect some information on Pokémon from the Hoenn region?
Thanks for your help, %PLAYERNAME%. Your Hoenn Pokédex is really looking great!
The Whismur you caught reminded me of a line from the text I told you about. It mentioned that a melody or a sound can awaken a sleeping Pokémon.
That gives me an idea... Let’s do a little experiment. There’s a sleeping Snorlax that hasn’t left my lab in months. And it’s right in front of my Berry stash!
Think we could wake it up with a loud noise? Let’s document the Whismur Evolution line, too—some photos will do.
Wow! That sure was loud, but it did the trick! Loudred worked just like an alarm clock for poor Snorlax.
I should make up for the rude awakening with some Berries... Well, we’ve learned something important here, and I think this method could work to awaken even the deepest of sleepers. 
If my calculations are correct, the wish-granting Mythical Pokémon might be ready to awaken soon, and we should be prepared to do the waking! 
The text says that the Pokémon is a Steel and Psychic type, so I think a good next step is to catch a few Pokémon with similar characteristics.
We’ll need a few extra hands to get this done, too. Could you get some fellow Trainers to help out?
Good work, %PLAYERNAME%. With the help of your research, I’ve been able to decipher more of this ancient text. 
It says that when the Mythical Pokémon awakens, it will grant any wishes written on notes attached to its head. 
Another interesting tidbit: If this Pokémon senses danger, it will fight without awakening. Up for a Trainer Battle, %PLAYERNAME%? 
If the battle causes any reactions nearby, I have sensors set up to detect them. It might seem like a long shot, but I have a good feeling about this!
It worked! I’m picking up some vibrations nearby. I think we’re on the right track.
Maybe the Mythical Pokémon is close to awakening. Since what we’re doing is working, let’s keep it up.
We need to pull out all the stops, though, and the timing has to be just right.
I’ll hold things down here with Loudred while you keep focusing on encountering Steel- and Psychic-type Pokémon.
If you can do that, I think it’ll help the Mythical Pokémon see that you’re a worthy Trainer!
Simply astonishing! We encountered the Steel- and Psychic-type Pokémon Jirachi!
That was a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Well, once in several lifetimes, if Jirachi truly only wakes once every thousand years.
You’ve become such an accomplished Trainer, %PLAYERNAME%. Thank you for going on this amazing adventure with me.
You can bet I’ll be in touch whenever another exciting research project comes up. Until then, let’s get out there and GO!
How was 2019 for you, %PLAYERNAME%? For me, it was a fantastic year, and I want to thank you and all our Trainers around the world for your hard work.
Together, we took on Team GO Rocket, uncovered the Wish Pokémon, Jirachi, and began encountering Pokémon originally discovered in Unova.
I want to make sure you know how proud I am of how much you and all the other Trainers have grown this last year!
And now with 2020 on the horizon, there are sure to be many more adventures awaiting! Until then, let’s get up and GO!

Good to see you again, %PLAYERNAME%. Have you noticed an increased number of Abra in the area?
Yes, so did I. I originally thought this strange phenomenon was happening due to Abra’s ability to teleport.
When Abra decides to teleport randomly, it creates the illusion that it’s made copies of itself.
However, what’s happening right now really does seem to be a large number of Abra appearing in the wild! Let’s research more about Abra and see what we can discover about the Psi Pokémon!
Fantastic work, %PLAYERNAME%! Are you having difficulty catching Abra you encounter?
It’s said that you must clear your mind if you want to catch an Abra.
Or maybe you could ask your buddy for some catching assistance!
I’ve got a few more things about Abra that I could use your help researching. How about you give me a hand, and I’ll see if I can find a nice treat for your buddy?
I’m sure your buddy appreciates that delicious Poffin! I’m more of a Pinap Berry man myself.
While researching Abra, I read that it can sense danger and maintains a telepathic radar even while it’s sleeping! What amazing abilities!
Why don’t you keep researching? As a token of my thanks, I’ll give you one of the Rocket Radars I’ve developed.
While it won’t give you Abra’s ability to sense danger while sleeping, it will help you track down any trouble the Team GO Rocket Leaders are stirring up.
Thank you again, %PLAYERNAME%, for all your help today. It was incredible researching Abra with you.
We learned so much about this Psychic-type Pokémon. Rumor has it that some lucky Trainers even encountered Shiny Abra in the wild!
Pokémon are truly amazing creatures. There’s always something to discover.
Until next time, %PLAYERNAME%!
%PLAYERNAME%, you’ve been such a help in conducting Field Research and Special Research!
I have a feeling that there’s so much more about this world that we’ve yet to discover, and I’m glad I can count on you to see it through.
I’ve been doing some experiments of my own, and I suspect that I’m onto a further exciting discovery about another Mythical Pokémon that’s rarely seen.
Would you mind completing these tasks while I conclude my studies?
Please {0}, {1}, and {2}.
Wow, you and your Pokémon have some amazing power! But according to my most recent data, it seems that the Mythical Pokémon I’m tracking only appears in times of peace.
Also, from what I’ve gathered, it seems fond of forests and lush greens. Would you mind exploring this further, %PLAYERNAME%?
Let's {0}, {1}, and {2}.
Excellent work, %PLAYERNAME%! I feel we’re getting closer to this Mythical Pokémon. I wonder if we can find some more friends for it by hatching some Eggs.
Ah, and maybe you could put that Sun Stone you’ve earned to good use as well?
Please {0}, {1}, and {2}.
Oh wow, is that an Eevee you’ve caught? Perfect timing!
Did you know that this Pokémon’s unstable genetic makeup enables it to take on one of several different Evolutions?
I’ll bet if you spend some time with it during the day, you’ll be able to evolve your Eevee into an Espeon—a Psychic-type Pokémon just like the Mythical Pokémon I’m researching!
Can you {0}, {1}, and {2}?
Oh wow, is that an Eevee you’ve caught? Perfect timing!
Wait... Have we...had this conversation already? I’m getting a funny feeling in the back of my mind—like we’ve been here before.
%PLAYERNAME%, would you spend some time with this Eevee during the night? I think you’ll be able to see an intriguing evolved form as a result.
I wonder if this funny feeling will recur...
Please {0}, {1}, and {2}.
%PLAYERNAME%, I have some exciting news! That funny feeling hasn’t returned, but I did some important reading and learned that the Mythical Pokémon we’re researching has the ability to travel across time!
Maybe that’s why all of this is occurring...or recurring... Maybe this Pokémon is nearby?!
I suggest that you collect samples over the course of the next week and experiment with some Evolution items to see whether that feeling occurs again.
While you’re at it, do you have any Pinap Berries? My research could benefit from more data on their use. Return with that, and you can have these exotic Silver Pinap Berries!
Please {0}, {1}, and {2}.
This data is so helpful. Thank you! I’ll use it to explore my theory.
While you were in the field, I made more headway in learning about this Mythical Pokémon, and it seems that its mere presence causes grass and trees to flourish.
I think if you catch more Grass-type Pokémon, this elusive time-traveling Pokémon will reveal itself!
Let's {0}, {1}, and {2}.
%PLAYERNAME%, what an amazing experience! The appearance of the Mythical Pokémon Celebi is thought to be a sign that a bright and shining future awaits us.
You’ve come a long way in your research, and I must say you’re inspiring me to discover even more Pokémon. Until next time, %PLAYERNAME%!
%PLAYERNAME%! Thank goodness you made it.
I was ready for a fun-filled day of playing with Pokémon, but as you may have seen, the park has all sorts of unusual geological phenomena occurring!
We need to figure out what’s happening and set it right, so I'm asking for your help.
Now that you’re here, I need you to be part of my Elite Research team.
First things first—could you help survey the park and get some supplies?
Please complete the following research tasks.{0}{1}{2}
Yowzers! As you may have noticed, the park has all sorts of unusual geological phenomena going on today!
I’m not sure what could have caused it—they just appeared out of nowhere...and they seem to be getting bigger and bigger!
Whatever is causing it, the local park habitat here is quite disrupted by all the changes.
The local Pokémon have become confused… It looks like they’re acting more aggressive and territorial!
Let's see if we can help out by catching some Pokémon to make the situation a bit more stable.
Please catch some Fire-, Steel-, Water-, Grass-, Rock-, and Ice-type Pokémon!
Well, it looks like there were some pretty powerful Pokémon causing the ruckus. Thanks for taking care of them! I'm sure they'll make great friends.
However, I'm not sure that was sufficient—the strange habitats are just as active as before. The local park and all the Pokémon here seem worried. We need to get to the bottom of this!
I've been seeing some unusual Pokémon called Unown floating around the area...
This Pokémon is shaped like ancient writing…and I think they may be trying to tell us something! I think they want us to call on a powerful Pokémon—the Guardian of the Forest? I'll bet if we follow the Unown around the park, they'll lead us to this Pokémon!
Let's do the following research tasks.{0}{1}{2}
Amazing! Never thought I would see Celebi here.
I think Celebi's time travel abilities may be exactly what we need to fix the situation.
Celebi can go back in time and stop these distortions while they're still small!
It's a difficult task… We need to ensure Celebi has all the support it needs!
The Plusle and Minun in the park would be perfect to help us out.
These Pokémon are famous for loving teamwork and cheering on their partners with their pom-poms made of sparks!
If we collect a bunch, I think they'll be able to work together to get Celebi really pumped up!
Then Celebi can focus its power to return to the past and prevent this problem before it starts!
Quickly, %PLAYERNAME%, let's complete these research tasks!{0}{1}
That did it! It seems like the strange habitats are slowly returning to normal.
It appears that Celebi has safely returned from the past to stay with you. Looks like you two have formed a bond!
I'll bet by next weekend the park will have returned to its old self! Celebi is truly a wondrous Pokémon!
Thanks for all your help today! We couldn't have done it without you.
This weekend will be one to remember!
%PLAYERNAME%, it’s always great to see you! I’m sure you know this, but your help in progressing my research has been essential to major breakthroughs in my work.
That’s why I’ve come to talk to you again. You probably already know what I’ll be asking!
I need your assistance in learning more about the newly discovered Pokémon that has really sent me and other Pokémon researchers into quite a tizzy.
Can you believe an undiscovered Pokémon just appeared out of the blue? You can imagine how everyone is talking about it!
I was checking a nearby habitat when I ran into a nest of them, and I was so excited, I dropped my camera! Don’t worry, though... I’m sure the repairs won’t cost me too much at the shop...
Although each Pokémon turned out to be a Ditto using the move Transform, that didn’t put a damper on my day!
So many Ditto taking on this unique Pokémon form must mean that the real Pokémon is truly out there, just waiting to be found.
Let’s get to work, %PLAYERNAME%! I know we don’t have much to go on, but I’m confident your hard work can only bring us good fortune!
But first, let me recalibrate my instruments for your area. Could you please complete the following tasks?{0}{1}{2}
Thanks, %PLAYERNAME%! I think that will be enough to help me properly conduct calculations based on the data you’ll gather in the field.
While you were out, I scanned some academic journals to see if any of my fellow researchers have encountered a Pokémon matching the description of the species I saw, but I didn’t have much luck.
But I do have a hunch! Given that this Pokémon has been unseen until just recently, I think it’s safe to say that we’re tracking another Mythical Pokémon, like Mew and Celebi.
If I’m right and this elusive Pokémon is a Mythical Pokémon, we should be able to draw it out by creating specific conditions under which it thrives.
But let’s step back for a minute, before we take a step forward. Or many steps forward, in this case! Great fieldwork starts with a walk. Could you complete a few tasks for me?
Also, remind me to contact my mentor, Professor Oak. I’m certain his brilliant mind will have something to lend to all this...
Please complete the following tasks.{0}{1}{2}
%PLAYERNAME%, I gave Professor Oak a call, and he pulled through! He says that the Pokémon is called Meltan! I think the name has a nice ring to it—don’t you?
Professor Oak got this information through an ancient text found in his archives, which included the appearance of Meltan.
What luck! Did you know that when Professor Oak was my instructor, he was my role model? And he still is!
He and I are of the same opinion that Meltan is a Mythical Pokémon, so I really think we’re on to something!
Still, a name alone isn’t going to get us very far... Perhaps the Ditto know something we don’t?
I think that if we find Ditto, we’ll be able to figure out how they acquired this curious transformation, and maybe that will lead us to Meltan.
Observation will be the best way forward, so let’s roll up our sleeves and get to work!
Please complete the following tasks.{0}{1}{2}
Excellent work, %PLAYERNAME%! The Ditto you’ve helped me analyze indeed has transformed into Meltan before. In fact, it was able to use Transform and let me analyze Meltan up close!
This Ditto was very helpful, even though it couldn’t replicate some of the finer details. It seems the memory of Meltan is fading away...
But I have good news! I was able to tell that Meltan has a liquid-metal body with a nutlike head and a tail that looks like a power cord. Judging from the appearance, it may be an Electric- or Steel-type Pokémon.
In order to make more progress, I think we should study these types of Pokémon! Can you complete the following tasks?{0}{1}{2}
Great news, %PLAYERNAME%! Thanks to all the data you’ve collected, I was able to make a detailed study of the differences between Electric-type Pokémon and Steel-type Pokémon.
Thankfully, the Ditto was able to use Transform one more time! It took me some time to figure out it was attracted to all my metal equipment.
Then I realized that it was copying every aspect of Meltan, including its behavioral patterns. Given the Ditto’s behavior, I believe Meltan is capable of assimilating metal by melting metal objects. What an interesting ability!
I can now say that, according to my research, Meltan is a Steel-type Pokémon!
I think our next step is to study more Pokémon that have similar characteristics. Can you complete the following tasks to learn more about Pokémon with fluid body surfaces or stomach acid strong enough to melt metals?
{0}{1}{2}
Oh, and one more thing—Professor Oak is also studying a Ditto in his own lab that is able to Transform into Meltan. With our parallel research, I think we’ll be able to make some breakthroughs soon!
By the time you complete all the research tasks, I should be able to circle back to you with the latest development.
Just in the nick of time, %PLAYERNAME%! With careful study of the Ditto that I sent him and the small amount of documented Meltan encounters, Professor Oak was able to solve more mysteries related to this Pokémon.
Meltan very well may have split from a Pokémon named Melmetal, which has been recorded even less than Meltan. Never before have we seen a Mythical Pokémon that can divide into multiple, independent Pokémon!
This explains why the world saw a simultaneous appearance of so many Ditto disguised as Meltan.
Professor Oak and I have made a guess as to how Meltan can re-form back into Melmetal—because Meltan have bodies similar to molten metal, they have a unique ability to merge and trigger an Evolution into Melmetal!
Do you know what Pokémon we should research next? You’re bright, %PLAYERNAME%, so I know you know the answer! I need you to collect data on Pokémon for which several parts can come together and act as one.
Can you complete the following tasks?{0}{1}{2}
Wow, I’m impressed! %PLAYERNAME%! Your data has arrived just as I’ve finished putting pieces of evidence together to learn Melmetal’s place in history.
According to these records, Melmetal was once regarded as a sacred being in a secluded community deep inside a wooded land that was rich with magnetite-bearing sedimentary rock.
People there developed ways to make unique tools out of metal shed by Melmetal. Without such metal, they couldn’t have made these tools back then.
We need to find out more about Pokémon that wield tools. Could you complete the following research tasks?{0}{1}{2}
I just received an important piece of news, %PLAYERNAME%! Remember the ancient text? It seems that a mysterious box was also excavated from the same site where the ancient text was found.
There was nothing in the box except a rusty lump of metal that bears interesting similarities to Meltan.
Perhaps exposing the box to this vast natural environment could cause something enigmatic to happen, resulting in Meltan changing states as well.
Exposing this metal to the open air could have had an entirely different effect on what’s inside the box, but we won’t know until we try it.
We may be able to find a clue about the lump of metal by delving into the world of ancient Pokémon.
Please complete the following tasks.{0}{1}{2}
I was right, %PLAYERNAME%! This artifact is truly Meltan! We did it!
Of course, the reason for Meltan’s presence inside this mysterious box can only be guessed. Maybe the people who glorified and worshiped Melmetal decided to keep it safe when the Pokémon somehow split itself apart.
Doing so could have been thought of as the only way for the people to ever meet Melmetal again. That warms the heart a little, doesn’t it, %PLAYERNAME%?
Make sure you give Meltan plenty of chances to see the vast world we live in by venturing out and exploring! Who knows what will happen from here...
Enjoy exploring, %PLAYERNAME%, and I’m sure we’ll be in touch soon!
%PLAYERNAME%, how are you? It’s been a while, hasn’t it? You’ve become quite the Trainer!
I wanted to ask for your help. As you know, I study Pokémon and their habitats. I’ve learned a lot over the years, but recently, I’ve found some hints of something mysterious.
I was wondering if you would help me investigate what's going on.
You will? That’s great!
First things first, let’s calibrate my instruments to your area.
Could you please complete the following research tasks?{0}{1}{2}
Great. Thanks, %PLAYERNAME%! Now I should be able to detect anything out of the ordinary.
I believe we need to be on the lookout for a Mythical Pokémon! Mythical Pokémon are extremely rare and unique, and many consider their existence to be mere rumor.
Could you help get my equipment set up around your local habitat? This’ll be a great time to take your buddy out to explore a bit and hatch some Eggs!
Please complete the following research tasks.{0}{1}{2}
Incredible! This confirms my initial suspicion. I think we’re seeing evidence of Mew!
A Pokémon found in a jungle far to the south that was thought to have been extinct. It is so rare that many experts say that it is a myth. %BREAK%Only a few people have seen it worldwide. Apparently, it appears only to those people who are pure of heart and have a strong desire to see it.
My colleagues in Kanto, including my instructor, Professor Oak, spent a long time studying Mew. It looks like our findings match theirs!
According to our research, Mew was said to be observed using moves of all kinds. This observation has led some of us to say that Mew is the ancestor of all Pokémon!
Perhaps by studying Pokémon in battle, we’ll learn more!
Please perform the following research tasks.{0}{1}{2}
Great work, %PLAYERNAME%! This will help point us in the right direction.
Did you know Mew is said to hold the genetic codes of all Pokémon? Mew’s secrets could be a link to understanding the mystery of Pokémon growth and Evolution!
Let's study some Pokémon Evolution to learn more about Mew!
Please perform these research tasks for me.{0}{1}{2}
Amazing. Just amazing! Isn’t Evolution wondrous? I learn something new every time I see it!
With the data we’ve collected so far, I should be able to pinpoint Mew’s location! It looks like...
Yes, it looks like Mew has visited your area recently! Hmm... Interesting. If that's the case, someone should have reported a sighting...
Maybe Mew is hiding or disguised as another Pokémon? Let's study some other Pokémon that use these tricks and the best ways to catch them!
Please perform the following research tasks.{0}{1}{2}
Thank you, %PLAYERNAME%! With your help, I’ve determined that Mew is invisible!
Let's collect some data to build a tool to find it. I have an idea... I’ll need you to study some powerful Pokémon up close to help me out!
Could you complete the following research tasks?{0}{1}{2}
Nice! My prototype is functioning well. I’ve upgraded your AR camera with the new ability to see invisible Pokémon!
The final step is to lure out Mew. Mew is said only to appear to those who are pure of heart and have a strong desire to meet it...
Let’s show Mew what a great Trainer you are and how excited we are to see it!
Please carry out the following research tasks.{0}{1}{2}
We found Mew! Awesome! This is an experience to remember forever.
Now you can see why I love studying Pokémon so much! The whole world is out there to discover. So go have some fun!
My assistants and I will request some Special Research from you in the future. Stay in touch!
Hi, %PLAYERNAME%, I’m glad to see you! Can I get your help with investigating something?
I’ve noticed an alarming number of reports from Trainers who have found PokéStops that look...discolored?
Some Trainers have even spotted people wearing shirts with a big letter R on them who are guarding these PokéStops.
These shady characters appear to have Pokémon with a mysterious dark aura around them!
As I investigate this with Spark, it might be best to power up some of your Pokémon. You never know what we might encounter...
Great job strengthening your Pokémon!
After visiting one of the PokéStops with Spark, we were challenged to a Trainer Battle by someone who belongs to an organization called Team GO Rocket!
Turns out that Team GO Rocket has been stealing resources from PokéStops with the help of Pokémon that are cloaked in a dark aura. They’re called Shadow Pokémon!
Luckily, we won the battle, and afterward, Team GO Rocket carelessly abandoned their defeated Shadow Pokémon!
Help us protect local PokéStops from Team GO Rocket, Trainer! As you do so, please save any Shadow Pokémon that Team GO Rocket abandons!
Thanks for all your hard work, %PLAYERNAME%! Candela and I have done some research on Shadow Pokémon and learned some very unsettling things.
While Pokémon naturally become stronger through training, these Shadow Pokémon seem to have been overpowered through unnatural means.
As a result, their bodies painfully struggle with not knowing how to control this strength. 
But don’t worry! It looks like we can help them harness this strength through a process called purification.
Can you help me purify some Shadow Pokémon, %PLAYERNAME%?
WOW! Thanks for helping us learn more about the Shadow Pokémon that Team GO Rocket uses, Trainer!
After observing the purification process with Blanche, it’s clear that the Pokémon’s gratefulness to you for purifying them causes the move Frustration to be replaced with Return!
Now that you have this knowledge, we need your help with saving as many Shadow Pokémon as possible by taking back PokéStops that are under Team GO Rocket’s control!
The world is under attack! Can we count on you to help protect it? I do hope there’s nothing more to this...
Thanks for your help in defeating Team GO Rocket Grunts, %PLAYERNAME%!
The team leaders and I have been observing Team GO Rocket, and something tells us this is far from over.
The transmission sent during the Team GO Rocket take-over had a message from an unknown sender at the end.
We’re going to need all the help we can get to reveal the identity of this unknown figure looming in the shadows, and you are just the Trainer for the job!
Can you help us get to the bottom of this mystery?
Thank you for your continued support against those pesky Team GO Rocket Grunts.
As they flee, some Grunts are leaving behind Mysterious Components.
I believe these are what Team GO Rocket is using to hack and steal resources from PokéStops. Clever little devices, aren’t they?
There’s information we can glean from these components that will help us in our fight against this dangerous organization.
Once you have enough pieces, you should be able to assemble something similar to the device I’ve modified in my lab. It might be best to prepare yourself for whatever might come, %PLAYERNAME%.
Interesting. It appears there’s more to Team GO Rocket than previously thought.
Their ingenuity has got me thinking there might be another use for these Mysterious Components. We shouldn’t underestimate Team GO Rocket.
It’s time to get battle ready, %PLAYERNAME%.
I don’t want to send you out to face another foe without some more training.
While you sharpen your battle skills, I’ll be sure to get this little project of mine up and operational.
Fantastic work, Trainer. I’ve been working on a prototype for something I call the Rocket Radar, but I was missing some critical components.
Your hard work in retrieving these components actually made my device work!
If we combine my research and these Mysterious Components you’ve found, we can create a radar-like tool to track down Team GO Rocket Hideouts!
Trainers all over the world are figuring out how to put together devices like this, and they’re identifying more hideouts than I originally anticipated.
%PLAYERNAME%, it’s time to head to these hideouts and face whatever—or whomever—is there head on. Let’s GO.
You battled well, %PLAYERNAME%! You’ve done your team leaders—and me—proud.
According to my observations, it appears the sender of that mysterious transmission during the Team GO Rocket take-over was not in attendance.
There’s someone else calling the shots—someone above Sierra, Cliff, and Arlo.
I’ve improved on my previous invention and put together a Super Rocket Radar that should help you track this mastermind down.
If it is who I think it is, he signs all his messages with “G.”
Astounding work, %PLAYERNAME%! 
You’ve put a stop to Team GO Rocket’s plans for the time being and rescued a special Shadow Pokémon!
It’s unlikely that Giovanni will give up this easily, so I hope we can rely on you to take down Team GO Rocket members as they appear around your area.
Spark, Blanche, and Candela will be on the lookout as well.
I’m sure Team GO Rocket will try to hatch another villainous plot soon...
Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%. Thanks for your help holding back Team GO Rocket’s forces. It’s good to know I can rely on you.
However, something tells me Team GO Rocket won’t be going away anytime soon, so we’re in it for the long haul. 
We need to think long-term about our strategy when it comes to Team GO Rocket.
I want to make sure only the most-prepared Trainers are equipped with Super Rocket Radar devices to track Giovanni.
I know you’re an accomplished Trainer, but let’s make sure your skills are keeping up with the challenge Team GO Rocket poses.
Astounding work, %PLAYERNAME%!
You know how purifying Shadow Pokémon makes them stronger afterward due to the gratitude they feel toward you for saving them?
Maybe one of the Pokémon you purify will become a trusted partner in our efforts to fight against Team GO Rocket’s invasion.
We need to continue saving and purifying these Pokémon.
Remember this: a good Trainer is strong, but a great Trainer is caring and kind.
Fantastic! Good work purifying all those Pokémon, %PLAYERNAME%. They’re practically glowing with gratitude!
It’s easy to tell Shadow and Purified Pokémon apart by the auras that surround them.
One of my favorite sights is a Purified Pokémon standing proud atop a Gym controlled by its Trainer’s team. It’s truly a thing to behold.
It’s time for you and your new friends to train alongside one another.
A difficult challenge awaits you, so you need to be prepared for battle, %PLAYERNAME%.
You should feel proud of your progress, %PLAYERNAME%.
The team leaders and I are certainly proud of how much you’ve grown as a Trainer.
I have one final task for you before I can be sure your skills are keeping up with an opponent like Giovanni.
If you can show me that you can still defeat the Team GO Rocket Leaders...
then I’ll know that you and your Pokémon are in top form.
Your skills are as impressive as ever. It’s time for you to take a Super Rocket Radar and see if you can track down the boss himself.
%PLAYERNAME%, I think you’re ready to take on Giovanni again.
You’ve proven your strength in battle, and you’ve also shown your compassion by saving and purifying Shadow Pokémon.
So get out there and confront Giovanni. With loyal Pokémon at your side and lots of experience under your belt, you’re unstoppable!
Good luck, %PLAYERNAME%!
Fantastic work, %PLAYERNAME%! You should enjoy your victory, of course, but it looks like our work isn’t done.
While you were busy, I was doing some reconnaissance. I have to admit, it’s been quite thrilling!
As you might have guessed, there are many more hideouts and headquarters out there that the Team GO Rocket Leaders and Giovanni could be hiding in.
We may have defeated them for the moment, but I’m sure they’ll be back and causing more trouble soon.
When that day comes, be sure you’re ready for the challenge!
Good to see you again, %PLAYERNAME%.
I’m sure you’ve seen that Team GO Rocket has continued their plans to take over PokéStops and turn even more Pokémon into Shadow Pokémon.
Have you seen an increase in Team GO Rocket activity in your area?
The team leaders and I have been getting reports from Trainers all over the world that these villains haven’t given up.
We need to keep working to save Pokémon from these no-good Grunts and their leaders.
Incredible work, %PLAYERNAME%.
Persistence and determination are key in our continued efforts to take down Team GO Rocket!
Please keep it up.
It’s time to purify more Shadow Pokémon.
They have you to thank for saving them! Perhaps one of the Pokémon you saved will become an essential member of your battle team.
How has your training been going, %PLAYERNAME%?
Be sure to build a healthy habit of improving yourself!
Training isn’t a one-and-done thing.
Becoming a great Trainer is something that comes with continued practice.
It’s important that you’re prepared for the challenges ahead, so let’s GO!
All right! You make the team leaders—and me—proud, %PLAYERNAME%.
It’s time to head out and show those Team GO Rocket Leaders that we’re strong enough to hold our own.
We can’t let these bullies get in our way when we’re saving Pokémon!
Fantastic work. Have you noticed, %PLAYERNAME%?
There seems to be a trend behind which Pokémon Giovanni is turning into Shadow Pokémon. I’m thinking about the fact that he has Legendary Shadow Pokémon.
Could that have anything to do with why he’s here?
In any case, the time has come to track him down.
The more we battle Giovanni and his team of Grunts, the more we learn about why he’s waging these take-overs.
You’ve shown what it takes to be a true Trainer, %PLAYERNAME%.
Your battle with Giovanni wasn’t easy, but the skills you’ve learned through practice and patience have paid off.
Keep your eyes open, Trainer. 
Giovanni does not like to lose, so I’m sure he’ll be back soon, trying to further his plans.
I’m sure I can count on you when he returns.
Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%. Thanks for your help battling Team GO Rocket. Trainers like you help keep Pokémon safe!
But this battle is far from over, and we must continue learning about Team GO Rocket, their leaders, and their boss, Giovanni.
Looks like the Rocket Radar I developed is helping the cause. I remember when this strange activity started happening...
Back then, I had a hunch the Mysterious Components that Team GO Rocket Grunts were leaving behind held more secrets than we originally thought. We’ve come quite a long way since then!
On that note, could you continue your work battling Grunts and helping Shadow Pokémon?
Wonderful work, %PLAYERNAME%.
I remember the first time we came across Shadow Pokémon. It was heartbreaking to see the pain they were in, and I knew I had to do something.
As a Pokémon Professor, I always want to contribute and help where I can. I may not be an accomplished battler like you, %PLAYERNAME%, but I can use my skills as a researcher and scientist to assist you on your journey.
That was why I started using Mysterious Components to build the prototype for the Rocket Radar. I hoped that Trainers like you could use it in our ongoing fight against Team GO Rocket and in our efforts to rescue more Pokémon.
So let’s get out there and do just that. I’m grateful for your help, especially now. It’s when times are toughest that we have the greatest opportunity to shine!
Thank you for purifying those Pokémon, %PLAYERNAME%. I’m sure they are just as grateful as I am for your dedication.
Rescuing these Pokémon was the main reason for my work on the Rocket Radar prototype.
Luckily, with the help of the team leaders and motivated Trainers like you, we were able to develop a functioning Rocket Radar and even start work on the Super Rocket Radar!
While a terrible situation, the Team GO Rocket invasion has been a thrilling adventure and research opportunity. I’m anxious but excited to send our findings over to my mentor, Professor Oak. I’ll be sure to let him know you said hello!
Now, it’s time to get back to work. Let’s test your battle skills, %PLAYERNAME%!
I’m always so impressed when Trainers use supereffective moves in battle. It’s a sign of greatness when you see a Trainer using type effectiveness to their advantage.
All our work lately seems to have gotten Team GO Rocket’s attention.
Reports are coming in that Sierra, Cliff, and Arlo are currently lurking in the area. You know what to do, %PLAYERNAME%!
I knew you could do it, %PLAYERNAME%. The more you practice, the better you’ll be able to take on those pesky Team GO Rocket Leaders. I’m sure they’re already scheming up their next plan after this defeat.
But now, Giovanni is waiting.
Using the Super Rocket Radar, track him down and defeat him. We must remain strong—Giovanni is relentless. I wonder why he continues his invasion...
There are so many resources and Pokémon in our world. His evil plans must have something to do with that. My research will continue, but we need you to face him.
Good luck, %PLAYERNAME%. We’re counting on you.
Fantastic work, %PLAYERNAME%!
I will definitely be adding your victory as a note to the research I send over to Professor Oak.
I’m sure he will be interested in anything you’ve learned about Shadow Pokémon and the continuing Team GO Rocket invasion, so please keep up your research and send it my way.
It may seem small, but every little bit helps!
I’ll be in touch soon, since we know Team GO Rocket isn’t likely to go anywhere. I know you’ll be ready for whatever happens next!
Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%. You’ve been instrumental in keeping back Team GO Rocket’s forces.
Thanks to your hard work, we’ve learned so much about this enemy.
Team GO Rocket won’t be going away anytime soon, so I’m glad I can rely on you and your fellow Trainers.
While you’ve done an amazing job so far, I’m looking for more opportunities for you to hone your skills. Every good Trainer needs to stay on their toes!
The Super Rocket Radar is in good hands with you on the task, but I wouldn’t be a good Professor if I didn’t make sure you were keeping up with Giovanni.
As expected, %PLAYERNAME%. Fantastic work!
Even though we’ve been fighting off the threat of Team GO Rocket for some time, I’m still concerned about the fact that Shadow Pokémon keep appearing.
It seems even more Pokémon are being turned into Shadow Pokémon despite our efforts. I’ve been tracking this situation, and the numbers have almost tripled since all this began.
We need to keep pushing forward—those Pokémon need our help! Can I rely on you to purify more Shadow Pokémon?
I’m sure you’ll see them shine with gratitude once you do!
Thank you for your efforts, %PLAYERNAME%.
I’m getting more and more concerned about the growing number of Shadow Pokémon, so we need to keep fighting back against this threat.
Your talent has made it clear that you’re ready for the next step in your preparations.
Use your battle skills to take on some Grunts. I think with some further observation, I can figure out what you need to do to make sure you’re at your best!
All right! You should feel proud of your progress, %PLAYERNAME%. You consistently impress me and the team leaders.
Candela could learn a thing or two from your battle prowess. I’m sure the Team GO Rocket Leaders see you as a challenge.
Take that challenge to them, and drive them out of wherever they’re holed up!
%PLAYERNAME%, your preparations are complete—you’re ready to take on Giovanni.
It’s time for you to use the Super Rocket Radar to track down the boss himself.
You’ve proven not only your strength in battle but also your compassion through saving and purifying Shadow Pokémon.
Confront Giovanni with that strength and compassion, and I believe he won’t be able to stop you!
Good luck, %PLAYERNAME%!
Well done, %PLAYERNAME%. You’ve shown Team GO Rocket just how strong your training has made you.
Although your battle with Giovanni wasn’t easy, the skills you’ve learned through practice and patience have paid off.
But keep your wits about you, %PLAYERNAME%.
Giovanni doesn’t like to lose, so I’m sure he’ll be back soon to further his plans.
I know I can count on you when he returns, but until then, I’ll work on finding some training opportunities for you so you can keep developing your skills.
Great to see you again, %PLAYERNAME%. You’ve done such an amazing job with every challenge I’ve given you.
Congrats on coming so far as a Trainer! You constantly impress me with your skills.
But there are so many aspects to Pokémon training! I think it’s time to switch things up. I spoke with Spark, and he thought it would be good for you to focus some more on taking care of Pokémon Eggs.
Why not take a walk with your buddy Pokémon after placing some Eggs into Incubators?
And be sure to rescue Shadow Pokémon from any Team GO Rocket members you encounter, too. Those Pokémon still need our help!
Wonderful work, %PLAYERNAME%. While you were busy, I met up with Blanche to discuss our research on recent developments with Shadow Pokémon.
I had observed that Team GO Rocket somehow seemed to be making Shadow Pokémon deal more damage with their attacks, though they also seem to take more damage in return now. My observations line up with Blanche’s research.
Both of us are concerned that despite our best efforts to push Team GO Rocket back, they’re still gaining ground and putting more and more Pokémon in danger.
While Blanche and I continue to investigate, can we depend on you to take down some more Grunts to slow Team GO Rocket down?
I’m also going to assign you some tasks to test you as a Trainer. Battling Grunts alone won’t keep your skills as sharp as they need to be to continue standing up to Team GO Rocket’s leaders.
Thanks for taking on those Grunts, %PLAYERNAME%.
I was working with Candela to figure out what challenges we could give you to help you prepare for battles with other Trainers and in the GO Battle League. Those skills carry over to doing battle with the Team GO Rocket Leaders, after all!
Candela was very excited to find ways to keep you on your toes!
Could you take on these challenges as part of your ongoing training?
You’ve done the team leaders proud, %PLAYERNAME%!
You took on those challenges like the skilled Trainer you are.
Great work. Now it’s time to continue the battle against Team GO Rocket.
Your efforts to rescue and purify Shadow Pokémon have certainly not gone unnoticed.
I’ll be sure to share any new findings about Team GO Rocket’s continued invasion as soon as they crop up, but right now, we should keep up the pressure on the Team GO Rocket Leaders. Good luck, %PLAYERNAME%.
Taking on the Team GO Rocket Leaders is no easy task. They have proven to be difficult opponents for even the most accomplished Trainers.
One interesting thing to note is that I’ve heard reports of Trainers rescuing Shiny Shadow Pokémon from the Team GO Rocket Leaders.
This only further supports my suspicions that Team GO Rocket is gathering large numbers of Pokémon if they’ve been able to find Shiny ones to turn into Shadow Pokémon.
There is definitely more that we need to learn about these foes and what their plans are.
For now, I need you to focus. It’s time to take on Giovanni himself. You got this, %PLAYERNAME%.
What an impressive victory, %PLAYERNAME%!
Giovanni is one of the toughest opponents out there, but your continued efforts to improve let you rise to the challenge! After this, I’m going to talk with the team leaders to discuss how we can further support you.
You’ve been an amazing part of the team, and we wouldn’t be able to keep these villains at bay without your skills and dedication.
But we can’t drop our guard while Team GO Rocket’s around, so keep honing your battle techniques. I suggest challenging your fellow Trainers to battles and testing yourself in the GO Battle League.
I’ll be in touch again soon, but until then, let’s GO!
Oh, %PLAYERNAME%! You’ve dropped by just in time.
As I was out on my regular walk one evening, I stumbled upon this odd stone. Something told me to bring it back to my lab for further research, and ever since then, strange things have been happening.
Papers shifting around, water glasses tipping all by themselves...
When I tried using my computer to research it, I got an error message with the number 108 flashing! %PLAYERNAME%, can you help gather some data on nearby Ghost-type Pokémon?
I have to believe we can solve these spooky occurrences with science!
%PLAYERNAME%, thanks so much for your help. I did some research on Ghost-type Pokémon, and I think there’s a Ghost- and Dark-type Pokémon that is bound to a strange stone.
I can’t say for sure just yet, but it seems this Pokémon may actually be composed of 108 spirits bound together. So maybe if we catch 108 Pokémon, it will appear?
Good luck, %PLAYERNAME%!  And...would you keep the light on in the lab for me? All this spooky research is making my hair stand on end.
Wow, %PLAYERNAME%! It seems we’ve had a spooky brush with Spiritomb!
I can’t tell if it’s the weather, but I’ve got the shivers! You know, I feel confident that we can solve anything together, %PLAYERNAME%, even when things get scary.
I'll be in touch soon!
Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! You surprised me, much like the Seedot that just fell from that tree over there.
It really scared a Pidgey that was foraging nearby, and I’m pretty sure it did that on purpose.
It’s easy for Seedot to trick people and Pokémon alike because Seedot are almost indistinguishable from acorns.
Are they appearing in higher numbers right now, or am I seeing double? Could you help me investigate this nutty situation?
Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! While you were away, I was just refreshing my memory on Seedot.
Apparently, it attaches itself to a tree branch using the top of its head and sucks moisture from the tree it’s hanging from. The more water Seedot drinks, the glossier its body becomes.
Thanks, Seedot, for reminding us to stay hydrated! Did you know that Seedot can evolve? AHHH! Sorry, I was just startled by another one.
Why don’t you try evolving Seedot? Maybe it’ll get calmer and stop playing pranks on everyone!
On the one hand, fantastic work, Trainer. Your little Seedot has evolved into Nuzleaf, the Wily Pokémon. On the other hand, our plan to calm Seedot down by evolving it has backfired.
Apparently, Nuzleaf can make a flute out of the leaf on its head, and the sound of that flute strikes fear and uncertainty into the hearts of people who hear it.
I’m sorry. But I have faith that a brave Trainer like yourself can handle Nuzleaf just fine!
Maybe if we try evolving it again...its next form will be less scary! Personally, I’ve been startled enough for one day of research!
So...your Nuzleaf has evolved into Shiftry, the Wicked Pokémon. Unfortunately, upon reviewing data on Shiftry, I learned it can be quite fearsome, too.
Using its leafy fan, Shiftry can create wind gusts with speeds of up to one hundred feet per second. That’s strong enough to level houses! I think I need to go tie my mobile lab down!
I’d rather be surprised by a Seedot than blown away by a Shiftry! Hah...lesson learned—stay up-to-date with Pokémon, even familiar ones!
Thank you for your help researching this odd occurrence. Once these winds die down, I’ll be in touch about our next research adventure!
Hi there, %PLAYERNAME%. I can’t help but be impressed by your progress. You’ve done fantastic work in researching Pokémon originally discovered in the Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, and Sinnoh regions.
Now that we’ve researched Pokémon that were found in those regions...
let’s take a closer look at Pokémon originally discovered in the Unova region!
I think it’s fascinating that even though we know a lot about Pokémon from all over the world, there’s always more to learn!
Speaking of discoveries, I’ve been doing some additional research and heard about an interesting phenomenon that has to do with Meowth in the Galar region.
I was speaking to a researcher who’s the granddaughter of a colleague from Galar, and she shared some intriguing information.
It seems that Galarian Meowth lived with seafaring people, which toughened their bodies so much that parts of them turned to iron.
Maybe I could get a few workout tips—I’ve been looking for some ways to toughen up myself!
Anyway...let’s do some more research on Pokémon originally discovered in Unova, but be sure to keep your eyes open for other exciting discoveries.
Wonderful work, Trainer. You might be familiar with the tradition in which a Pokémon Trainer selects their very first partner from a group of three Pokémon.
These first-partner Pokémon are normally Fire, Water, or Grass types. In Unova, many Trainers choose the Water-type Oshawott as their first-partner Pokémon.
This Sea Otter Pokémon is known to use the scalchop on its stomach during battle. Isn’t that just adorable? Please continue your research, and let me know your findings.
I can’t stop thinking about how cute Oshawott is... Oh! You’re back! Excellent work catching that Darumaka!
Now that we’ve researched the Water-type first-partner Pokémon of many Trainers from Unova, let’s shift focus to the Fire-type one—Tepig!
I’m a particular fan of Tepig because it uses the fireballs that come from its nose to roast Berries. It’s such a clever use of a skill.
I just love roasted Pinap Berries! We should continue our work and see what else we can discover.
Being the savvy Trainer you are, I’m sure you know which type of Pokémon we’re going to research next.
That’s right—Grass type! In Unova, many Trainers choose the Grass Snake Pokémon Snivy as their first partner. Snivy is intelligent and calm, and being exposed to lots of sunlight makes it move more swiftly.
Perhaps there’s a lot we could learn from such a sagacious Pokémon!
Anyway, let’s get started on these research tasks. Be sure to listen carefully, as you never know what you might encounter!
You’re a natural, %PLAYERNAME%. I’m so glad we could research some of the amazing Pokémon originally discovered in the Unova region.
I can’t thank you enough for your hard work. I hope you put this Charged TM and Fast TM to good use!
By the way, I literally stumbled across a mysterious Pokémon I’ve never encountered before.
I think you’re the perfect Trainer to take this Pokémon and help it reach its potential. Best of luck, and I’ll be in touch soon!
%PLAYERNAME%! Thank goodness you made it to this important research site.
I came to study Pokémon that commonly appear in this area, but it seems I need your help! The species of Pokémon I’ve observed today don’t normally appear around here. What a strange occurrence!
Would you be willing to travel throughout the park and perform some tasks for me? With all these wild Pokémon around, it almost feels like a safari!
Please complete the following research tasks: {0}{1}{2}{3}{4}
Wow, great work today! In addition to completing some insightful research, you’ve skillfully helped me document the amazing nature around us and the fascinating migration patterns that Pokémon follow. I have a feeling there’s even more to discover out here!
The results of your work have produced an awesome amount of Stardust. Perhaps you could find good use for it in powering up or trading a Pokémon! Enjoy, %PLAYERNAME%!

Ah, %PLAYERNAME%! Good to see you!
There’s a lot to do this summer! New things to experience—new Pokémon to find!
Let’s start with a few simple tasks to help you get your bearings.
Wow, is that a Dratini you’ve found? That’s quite a rare Pokémon!
I can tell this Dratini has the potential to become a close friend of yours! Why don’t you two take some time to get to know each other?
Impressive! Dragonair is a powerful Pokémon in its own right. Let’s get Dragonair ready to battle!
You can try taking on other Trainers or working together to take down huge Raid Bosses!
Nice work! You and your Pokémon make a great team!
There are many new kinds of Pokémon that have started appearing recently in the world.
You should take a look and see if you can find anything new.
Amazing! You found some rare Pokémon that were first discovered in the Sinnoh region already? And is that...a Shiny Pokémon?
Amazing! I’ve never seen an Eevee like that before! Shiny Pokémon have a rare and distinct coloration that sets them apart from others of their species!
Let’s commemorate this moment! Why don’t you take a snapshot and celebrate with friends?
Wow, a wild Lapras sought you out?
Looks like you’re going to do great this summer!
They say Trainers and Pokémon are most powerful when they band together.
Good luck! It’s time to GO!

This is probably a waste of my time, but I do love winning!
This won’t be all bad—when you lose, you’ll at least get to hear me say you made a good effort.
I won’t be surprised when I win.
It will be good for you to see a true Trainer like me in battle.
If you are as weak as your team leaders, then this fight will be easy.
You should probably take notes, dear.
I’ll never pass up an opportunity to show off on the battlefield!
Can we move this along? I’d love to stay and chat, but I have a meeting to get to.
You shouldn’t get in my way. You might get hurt, dear.
This is a challenge you should walk away from, dear.
I’ve lost my touch... But it will not happen again.
I underestimated you, but I will not make the same mistake again.
I can’t lose... What does this mean?
You win this time, but things’ll go differently next time we meet!
Ugh, these Pokémon are too weak for a Trainer like me!
How amusing! You dare to challenge me?
I’m not fond of dealing with weaklings. Pay attention! You might learn something.
Such an eager Trainer. I’ll happily defeat you.
Your inevitable loss will be such a good lesson.
Pay attention, Trainer. You just might learn something!
I’m getting tired of battling weaklings. Let’s get this over with.
Silly Trainer. You ought to know better than to oppose me.
You’ve had your fun. Now it’s time for you to fight me.
I can see this will be a struggle for you. Don’t worry. I’ll defeat you quickly.
It’s so cute how willing you are to accept your defeat. Let’s battle.
I wish I could enjoy this victory, but it wasn’t a surprise!
...Oh? You’re still here?
Move along, dear. Team GO Rocket always wins.
How...simple.
Come back when you can actually pose a challenge, dear!

Hey! The name's Spark—the leader of Team Instinct.
